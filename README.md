# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

## Overview

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) in Python. By leveraging the power of Haar cascades, the program detects faces in live video streams from a webcam. This project serves as an educational resource for understanding basic computer vision techniques and Python programming.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam feed.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Allows for easy customization and extension.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Webcam (built-in or external)
